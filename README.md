# Recipe App

This is my first real application: a recipe app that fetches data from the Spoonacular API. It is a responsive and real-time application where you can:

1. Search for specific recipes:
   - Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and detailed instructions.

2. Explore recipes using hashtags:
   - Recipes feature hashtags (e.g., #snacks). Clicking on a hashtag will use an algorithm to display random recipes with the same hashtag.

3. Add recipes to your favorites:
   - A dedicated Favorites page displays all the recipes you have favorited.

## Instructions for Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

2. npm install 

3. Create a .env file in the root directory. Go to : https://spoonacular.com/food-api    My Console -> Profile -> Hide/Show API key ->
Add your Spoonacular API key to the .env file: VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. npm start / npm run dev
